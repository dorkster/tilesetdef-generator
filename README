# Flare Tileset Definition Generator

This script allows for easy creation of a tileset definition for Flare (http://flarerpg.org) using an existing Tiled TMX file.



## Usage

Run this in the folder that contains your Tiled map and tileset images, replacing `FILENAME` with your map's filename:

```
./tilesetdef-generator.py FILENAME
```



## Notes

* Partial tilesets named `collision` and `set_rules` are ignored
* Tiles aren't packed, so the resulting tileset can be slightly inefficient. It's possible that in-game performance may suffer if the tileset image has large blank areas.
